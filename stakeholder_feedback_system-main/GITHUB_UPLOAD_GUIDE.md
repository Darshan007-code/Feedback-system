# 🚀 GitHub Upload Guide for Feedback System

This guide will help you upload your complete feedback system to GitHub.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: Create one at https://github.com if you don't have it
2. **Git**: Should be installed on your system

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Restart Your Terminal
Since Git was just installed, you need to restart your terminal/command prompt for it to be recognized.

### Step 2: Run the Helper Script
Double-click on `upload_to_github.bat` in your project folder, or run it from the terminal.

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
2. **Sign in** to your account
3. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
4. **Select "New repository"**
5. **Fill in the details**:
   - Repository name: `feedback-system` (or any name you prefer)
   - Description: `Complete web-based feedback system with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL`
   - Make it **Public** (recommended for portfolio)
   - **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 4: Copy Repository URL
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with commands. Copy the repository URL that looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/feedback-system.git
```

### Step 5: Connect and Upload

Run these commands in your terminal (replace `YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL` with the actual URL):

```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
